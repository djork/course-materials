Continuing Education Course on Applied Artifical Intelligence (CAAIT) Welcome to the Continuing Education Course (CEC01) of the 2023 EUROTOX Conference, Ljubljana, Slovenia. This course entitled ‘Applied Artificial Intelligence for Toxicology’ is meant as a primer. It consists of two seperate tracks: One focused on more starting researchers, and uses R as the main programming language. And one focused on more advanced researchers. The advanced track is more focused on the use of the Python programming language. This part of the course is the ‘Machine Learning with R part’ and these pages are the associated materials. Programme of this workshop An introduction to R and the tidyverse An introduction to Tidymodels in R (adapted from the Tidymodels documentation) An introduction to Read Accross, based on Compound similarity An introduction to Machine Learning approaches for classification of chemicals If you are already acquainted with R and a practiced user of the {tidyverse} suit of R packages, you can skip activity 1. If you are already familiar with the {tidymodels} workflow, you might want to skip or only glimpse over part 2 or take part in the advanced track. Please note: this is a crash course. We scheduled this course to allow you to throw yourself into R and be able to see yourself making progress very quickly. We wish you good luck and we hope you will have a lot of fun with R! Course material The course material consists of the following: Instruction pages (menu to the left). Exercises. To navigate through the different materials, you can use the menu on the left. Part 1 of this workshop is based on the online book R for Data Science. Part 2 is based on the Tidymodels documentation. Part 3 was adapted from TAME. Part 4 was created from scratch, but information and code examples were derived from tensorflow for R documentation R and RStudio During the course, we will use R the Integrated Development Environment RStudio, which you can download and install (in this order) for your system using the links below: Download R here Download RStudio here Note that R is Open Source and is licensed under a permissive licence for reuse, and redistribution. RStudio is Open Source, but developed by the company Posit, that also offers commercial versions of this and other Data Science software. The company has a very open science oriented culture and has provided very valuable contributions to the R Open Source Community.
